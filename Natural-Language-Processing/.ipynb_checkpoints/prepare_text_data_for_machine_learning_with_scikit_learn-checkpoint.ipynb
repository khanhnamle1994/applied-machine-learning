    "We cannot work with text directly when using machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we need to convert the text to numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may want to perform classification of documents, so each document is an “input” and a class label is the “output” for our predictive algorithm. Algorithms take vectors of numbers as input, therefore we need to convert documents to fixed-length vectors of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple and effective model for thinking about text documents in machine learning is called the Bag-of-Words Model, or BoW.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is simple in that it throws away all of the order information in the words and focuses on the occurrence of words in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by assigning each word a unique number. Then any document we see can be encoded as a fixed-length vector with the length of the vocabulary of known words. The value in each position in the vector could be filled with a count or frequency of each word in the encoded document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the bag of words model, where we are only concerned with encoding schemes that represent what words are present or the degree to which they are present in encoded documents without any information about order.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to extend this simple method, both by better clarifying what a “word” is and in defining what to encode about each word in the vector.\n",

    "## Word Counts with CountVectorizer\n",
    "The [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) provides a simple way to both tokenize a collection of text documents and build a vocabulary of known words, but also to encode new documents using that vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an instance of the CountVectorizer class.\n",
    "2. Call the fit() function in order to learn a vocabulary from one or more documents.\n",
    "3. Call the transform() function on one or more documents as needed to encode each as a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "An encoded vector is returned with a length of the entire vocabulary and an integer count for the number of times each word appeared in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these vectors will contain a lot of zeros, we call them sparse. Python provides an efficient way of handling sparse vectors in the [scipy.sparse](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectors returned from a call to transform() will be sparse vectors, and you can transform them back to numpy arrays to look and better understand what is going on by calling the toarray() function.\n",
