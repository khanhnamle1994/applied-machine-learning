    "# Understanding Stateful LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks in Python with Keras\n",
    "A powerful and popular recurrent neural network is the long short-term model network or LSTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is widely used because the architecture overcomes the vanishing and exposing gradient problem that plagues all recurrent neural networks, allowing very large and very deep networks to be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other recurrent neural networks, LSTM networks maintain state, and the specifics of how this is implemented in Keras framework can be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post you will discover exactly how state is maintained in LSTM networks by the Keras deep learning library.\n",

    "This is truly how the LSTM networks are intended to be used. We find that by allowing the network itself to learn the dependencies between the characters, that we need a smaller network (half the number of units) and fewer training epochs (almost half).\n",
    "\n",
    "We first need to define our LSTM layer as stateful. In so doing, we must explicitly specify the batch size as a dimension on the input shape. This also means that when we evaluate the network or make predictions, we must also specify and adhere to this same batch size. This is not a problem now as we are using a batch size of 1. This could introduce difficulties when making predictions when the batch size is not one as predictions will need to be made in batch and in sequence."
