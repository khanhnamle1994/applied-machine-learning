    "# How to Generate Random Numbers in Python\n",
    "The use of randomness is an important part of the configuration and evaluation of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the random initialization of weights in an artificial neural network, to the splitting of data into random train and test sets, to the random shuffling of a training dataset in stochastic gradient descent, generating random numbers and harnessing randomness is a required skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will discover how to generate and work with random numbers in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* That randomness can be applied in programs via the use of pseudorandom number generators.\n",
    "* How to generate random numbers and use randomness via the Python standard library.\n",
    "* How to generate arrays of random numbers via the NumPy library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started.\n",

    "## Tutorial Overview\n",
    "This tutorial is divided into 3 parts; they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pseudorandom Number Generators\n",
    "2. Random Numbers with Python\n",
    "3. Random Numbers with NumPy"

    "## 1. Pseudorandom Number Generators\n",
    "The source of randomness that we inject into our programs and algorithms is a mathematical trick called a pseudorandom number generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random number generator is a system that generates random numbers from a true source of randomness. Often something physical, such as a Geiger counter, where the results are turned into random numbers. We do not need true randomness in machine learning. Instead we can use pseudorandomness. Pseudorandomness is a sample of numbers that look close to random, but were generated using a deterministic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shuffling data and initializing coefficients with random values use pseudorandom number generators. These little programs are often a function that you can call that will return a random number. Called again, they will return a new random number. Wrapper functions are often also available and allow you to get your randomness as an integer, floating point, within a specific distribution, within a specific range, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers are generated in a sequence. The sequence is deterministic and is seeded with an initial number. If you do not explicitly seed the pseudorandom number generator, then it may use the current system time in seconds or milliseconds as the seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the seed does not matter. Choose anything you wish. What does matter is that the same seeding of the process will result in the same sequence of random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s make this concrete with some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Random Numbers with Python\n",
    "The Python standard library provides a module called random that offers a suite of functions for generating random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a popular and robust pseudorandom number generator called the Mersenne Twister.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will look at a number of use cases for generating and using random numbers and randomness with the standard Python API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seed The Random Number Generator\n",
    "The pseudorandom number generator is a mathematical function that generates a sequence of nearly random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes a parameter to start off the sequence, called the seed. The function is deterministic, meaning given the same seed, it will produce the same sequence of numbers every time. The choice of seed does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seed() function will seed the pseudorandom number generator, taking an integer value as an argument, such as 1 or 7. If the seed() function is not called prior to using randomness, the default is to use the current system time in milliseconds from epoch (1970).\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below demonstrates seeding the pseudorandom number generator, generates some random numbers, and shows that reseeding the generator will result in the same sequence of numbers being generated."
