    "# Introduction to Nonparametric Statistical Significance Tests in Python\n",
    "In applied machine learning, we often need to determine whether two data samples have the same or different distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can answer this question using statistical significance tests that can quantify the likelihood that the samples have the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data does not have the familiar Gaussian distribution, we must resort to nonparametric version of the significance tests. These tests operate in a similar manner, but are distribution free, requiring that real valued data be first transformed into rank data before the test can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will discover nonparametric statistical tests that you can use to determine if data samples were drawn from populations with the same or different distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Mann-Whitney U test for comparing independent data samples: the nonparametric version of the Student t-test.\n",
    "* The Wilcoxon signed-rank test for comparing paired data samples: the nonparametric version of the paired Student t-test.\n",
    "* The Kruskal-Wallis H and Friedman tests for comparing more than two data samples: the nonparametric version of the ANOVA and repeated measures ANOVA tests.\n",

    "## Nonparametric Statistical Significance Tests\n",
    "Nonparametric statistics are those methods that do not assume a specific distribution to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, they refer to statistical methods that do not assume a Gaussian distribution. They were developed for use with ordinal or interval data, but in practice can also be used with a ranking of real-valued observations in a data sample rather than on the observation values themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common question about two or more datasets is whether they are different. Specifically, whether the difference between their central tendency (e.g. mean or median) is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question can be answered for data samples that do not have a Gaussian distribution by using nonparametric statistical significance tests. The null hypothesis of these tests is often the assumption that both samples were drawn from a population with the same distribution, and therefore the same population parameters, such as mean or median.\n",
    "\n",
    "If after calculating the significance test on two or more samples the null hypothesis is rejected, it indicates that there is evidence to suggest that samples were drawn from different populations, and in turn the difference between sample estimates of population parameters, such as means or medians may be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tests are often used on samples of model skill scores in order to confirm that the difference in skill between machine learning models is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, each test calculates a test statistic, that must be interpreted with some background in statistics and a deeper knowledge of the statistical test itself. Tests also return a p-value that can be used to interpret the result of the test. The p-value can be thought of as the probability of observing the two data samples given the base assumption (null hypothesis) that the two samples were drawn from a population with the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value can be interpreted in the context of a chosen significance level called alpha. A common value for alpha is 5% or 0.05. If the p-value is below the significance level, then the test says there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and that the samples were likely drawn from populations with differing distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* p <= alpha: reject H0, different distribution.\n",
    "* p > alpha: accept H0, same distribution."

    "## Test Dataset\n",
    "Before we look at specific nonparametric significance tests, let’s first define a test dataset that we can use to demonstrate each test.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will generate two samples drawn from different distributions. We will draw the samples from Gaussian distributions for simplicity, although, as noted, the tests we review in this tutorial are for data samples where we do not know or assume any specific distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the randn() NumPy function to generate a sample of 100 Gaussian random numbers in each sample with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Observations in the first sample are scaled to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5. Observations in the second sample are scaled to have a mean of 51 and a standard deviation of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect the statistical tests to discover that the samples were drawn from differing distributions, although the small sample size of 100 observations per sample will add some noise to this decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete code example is listed below."
