    "# 7 Time Series Datasets for Machine Learning\n",
    "Machine learning can be applied to time series datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are problems where a numeric or categorical value must be predicted, but the rows of data are ordered by time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem when getting started in time series forecasting with machine learning is finding good quality standard datasets on which to practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, you will discover 8 standard time series datasets that you can use to get started and practice time series forecasting with machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading this post, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 4 univariate time series datasets.\n",
    "* 3 multivariate time series datasets.\n",
    "* Websites that you can use to search and download more datasets.\n",

    "## Univariate Time Series Datasets\n",
    "Time series datasets that only have one variable are called univariate datasets.\n",

    "These datasets are a great place to get started because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They are so simple and easy to understand.\n",
    "* You can plot them easily in excel or your favorite plotting tool.\n",
    "* You can easily plot the predictions compared to the expected results.\n",
    "* You can quickly try and evaluate a suite of traditional and newer methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The website Data Market provides access to a large number of time series datasets. Specifically, the [Time Series Data Library](https://datamarket.com/data/list/?q=provider:tsdl) created by [Rob Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/), Professor of Statistics at Monash University, Australia\n",
