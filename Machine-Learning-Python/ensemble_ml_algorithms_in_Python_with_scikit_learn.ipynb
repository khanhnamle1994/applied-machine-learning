    "# Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms in Python with scikit-learn\n",
    "Ensembles can give you a boost in accuracy on your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post you will discover how you can create some of the most powerful types of ensembles in Python using scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study will step you through Boosting, Bagging and Majority Voting and show you how you can continue to ratchet up the accuracy of the models on your own datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combine Model Predictions Into Ensemble Predictions\n",
    "The three most popular methods for combining the predictions from different models are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bagging**. Building multiple models (typically of the same type) from different subsamples of the training dataset.\n",
    "* **Boosting**. Building multiple models (typically of the same type) each of which learns to fix the prediction errors of a prior model in the chain.\n",
    "* **Voting**. Building multiple models (typically of differing types) and simple statistics (like calculating the mean) are used to combine predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post will not explain each of these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "It assumes you are generally familiar with machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods and that you are looking for information on how to create ensembles in Python."

    "## About the Recipes\n",
    "Each recipe in this post was designed to be standalone. This is so that you can copy-and-paste it into your project and start using it immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard classification problem from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used to demonstrate each ensemble algorithm. This is the Pima Indians onset of Diabetes dataset. It is a binary classification problem where all of the input variables are numeric and have differing scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ensemble algorithm is demonstrated using 10 fold cross validation, a standard technique used to estimate the performance of any machine learning algorithm on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bagging Algorithms\n",
    "Bootstrap Aggregation or bagging involves taking multiple samples from your training dataset (with replacement) and training a model for each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output prediction is averaged across the predictions of all of the sub-models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three bagging models covered in this section are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bagged Decision Trees\n",
    "2. Random Forest\n",
    "3. Extra Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Bagged Decision Trees\n",
    "Bagging performs best with algorithms that have high variance. A popular example are decision trees, often constructed without pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below see an example of using the BaggingClassifier with the Classification and Regression Trees algorithm (DecisionTreeClassifier). A total of 100 trees are created."
