    "## Evaluate XGBoost Models With Train and Test Sets\n",
    "The simplest method that we can use to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm is to use different training and testing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take our original dataset and split it into two parts. Train the algorithm on the first part, then make predictions on the second part and evaluate the predictions against the expected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the split can depend on the size and specifics of your dataset, although it is common to use 67% of the data for training and the remaining 33% for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm evaluation technique is fast. It is ideal for large datasets (millions of records) where there is strong evidence that both splits of the data are representative of the underlying problem. Because of the speed, it is useful to use this approach when the algorithm you are investigating is slow to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "A downside of this technique is that it can have a high variance. This means that differences in the training and test dataset can result in meaningful differences in the estimate of model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split the dataset into a train and test set using the **train_test_split()** function from the scikit-learn library. For example, we can split the dataset into a 67% and 33% split for training and test sets as follows:"

    "## Evaluate XGBoost Models With k-Fold Cross Validation\n",
    "Cross validation is an approach that you can use to estimate the performance of a machine learning algorithm with less variance than a single train-test set split.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works by splitting the dataset into k-parts (e.g. k=5 or k=10). Each split of the data is called a fold. The algorithm is trained on k-1 folds with one held back and tested on the held back fold. This is repeated so that each fold of the dataset is given a chance to be the held back test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running cross validation you end up with k different performance scores that you can summarize using a mean and a standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a more reliable estimate of the performance of the algorithm on new data given your test data. It is more accurate because the algorithm is trained and evaluated multiple times on different data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of k must allow the size of each test partition to be large enough to be a reasonable sample of the problem, whilst allowing enough repetitions of the train-test evaluation of the algorithm to provide a fair estimate of the algorithms performance on unseen data. For modest sized datasets in the thousands or tens of thousands of observations, k values of 3, 5 and 10 are common.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use k-fold cross validation support provided in scikit-learn. First we must create the KFold object specifying the number of folds and the size of the dataset. We can then use this scheme with the specific dataset. The **cross_val_score()** function from scikit-learn allows us to evaluate a model using the cross validation scheme and returns a list of the scores for each model trained on each fold."
