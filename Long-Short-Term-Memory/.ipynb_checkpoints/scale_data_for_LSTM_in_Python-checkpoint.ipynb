    "## Scaling Input Variables\n",
    "The input variables are those that the network takes on the input or visible layer in order to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is that input variables should be small values, probably in the range of 0-1 or standardized with a zero mean and a standard deviation of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether input variables require scaling depends on the specifics of your problem and of each variable. Let’s look at some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical Inputs\n",
    "You may have a sequence of categorical inputs, such as letters or statuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, categorical inputs are first integer encoded then one hot encoded. That is, a unique integer value is assigned to each distinct possible input, then a binary vector of ones and zeros is used to represent each integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, a one hot encoding will ensure that each input is a small real value, in this case 0.0 or 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Valued Inputs\n",
    "You may have a sequence of quantities as inputs, such as prices or temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the distribution of the quantity is normal, then it should be standardized, otherwise the series should be normalized. This applies if the range of quantity values is large (10s 100s, etc.) or small (0.01, 0.0001).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the quantity values are small (near 0-1) and the distribution is limited (e.g. standard deviation near 1) then perhaps you can get away with no scaling of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Inputs\n",
    "Problems can be complex and it may not be clear how to best scale input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If in doubt, normalize the input sequence. If you have the resources, explore modeling with the raw data, standardized data, and normalized and see if there is a beneficial difference."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Scaling Output Variables\n",
    "The output variable is the variable predicted by the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must ensure that the scale of your output variable matches the scale of the activation function (transfer function) on the output layer of your network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following heuristics should cover most sequence prediction problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Classification Problem\n",
    "If your problem is a binary classification problem, then the output will be class values 0 and 1. This is best modeled with a sigmoid activation function on the output layer. Output values will be real values between 0 and 1 that can be snapped to crisp values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-class Classification Problem\n",
    "If your problem is a multi-class classification problem, then the output will be a vector of binary class values between 0 and 1, one output per class value. This is best modeled with a softmax activation function on the output layer. Again, output values will be real values between 0 and 1 that can be snapped to crisp values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Problem\n",
    "If your problem is a regression problem, then the output will be a real value. This is best modeled with a linear activation function. If the distribution of the value is normal, then you can standardize the output variable. Otherwise, the output variable can be normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Problem\n",
    "There are many other activation functions that may be used on the output layer and the specifics of your problem may add confusion.\n",

    "## Practical Considerations When Scaling\n",
    "There are some practical considerations when scaling sequence data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Estimate Coefficients**. You can estimate coefficients (min and max values for normalization or mean and standard deviation for standardization) from the training data. Inspect these first-cut estimates and use domain knowledge or domain experts to help improve these estimates so that they will be usefully correct on all data in the future.\n",
    "* **Save Coefficients**. You will need to normalize new data in the future in exactly the same way as the data used to train your model. Save the coefficients used to file and load them later when you need to scale new data when making predictions.\n",
    "* **Data Analysis**. Use data analysis to help you better understand your data. For example, a simple histogram can help you quickly get a feeling for the distribution of quantities to see if standardization would make sense.\n",
    "* **Scale Each Series**. If your problem has multiple series, treat each as a separate variable and in turn scale them separately.\n",
    "* **Scale At The Right Time**. It is important to apply any scaling transforms at the right time. For example, if you have a series of quantities that is non-stationary, it may be appropriate to scale after first making your data stationary. It would not be appropriate to scale the series after it has been transformed into a supervised learning problem as each column would be handled differently, which would be incorrect.\n",
    "* **Scale if in Doubt**. You probably do need to rescale your input and output variables. If in doubt, at least normalize your data.\n",
